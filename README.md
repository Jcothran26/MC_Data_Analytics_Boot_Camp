# MC_Data_Analytics_Boot_Camp
The jupyter notebook contains the python code that I developed for the final project at the Montgomery College Data Analytics Boot Camp
Our project required us to develop analytics and visualizations of nearly a million Kickstarter campaigns
on the basis of money raised, backers, status, or any other relevant metric.
